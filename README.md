### Hey there!

* I'm a plant community ecologist interested in how plant communities and their associated ecosystem functions are impacted by human-driven global changes.
* I currently study the aspects of temperate grassland communities that promote global change resilience and acclimation using long-term data from [KBS LTER](https://lter.kbs.msu.edu) and [Cedar Creek LTER](https://cedarcreek.umn.edu).
* I'm wrapping up my doctorate, and I'm excited to pursue job opportunities that bridge the gap between basic and applied research to address climate change adaptation!

#### Education
* Ph.D. Evolution, Ecology & Behavior â€” Indiana University
* M.S. Ecology, Evolution & Conservation Biology â€” University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
