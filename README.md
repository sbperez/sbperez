### Hey there!

* I'm a postdoc at the [Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (SE CASC)](https://secasc.ncsu.edu) working on synthesizing the impacts of extreme, compounding events throughout the Southeast.
* I'm a plant community ecologist by training, and I'm broadly interested in how plant communities and their associated ecosystem functions are impacted by human-driven global changes, particularly through data synthesis.
