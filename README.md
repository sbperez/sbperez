### Hey there!

I'm a postdoc at the [Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (SE CASC)](https://secasc.ncsu.edu) at North Carolina State University. I'm a plant community ecologist interested in how plant species and communities and their associated ecosystem functions are being impacted by human-driven global changes. In my current work I'm synthesizing the ecological impacts of extreme and compounding climatic events throughout the Southeast US.
